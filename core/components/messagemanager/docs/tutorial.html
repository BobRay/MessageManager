<p>MessageManager lets users see and delete their messages in the front end of the site. Depending on the configuration, they can also reply to messages and send messages to another user, all members of a User Group, or all users on the site. Optionally, users can opt in or out of receiving message based on their member ship in a particular user group.</p>
